Observer is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects:
observable and observers. An observable is an object which notifies observers about
the changes in its state.

For example, a news agency can notify channels when it receives news.
Receiving news is what changes the state of the news agency,
and it causes the channels to be notified.
