In chain of responsibility, sender sends a request to a chain of objects.
The request can be handled by any object in the chain.

A Chain of Responsibility Pattern says that just
"avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver
by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request"


In other words, we can say that normally each receiver contains reference of another
receiver. If one object cannot handle the request then it passes the same to
the next receiver and so on.
