It is used to perform an operation on a group of similar kinds of
Objects at runtime. It decouples the operations from an object structure.
Using visitor patterns, we can easily add new behaviors to the existing class
hierarchy without changing the existing code


the primary goal of the visitor pattern is to moves the operational logic
from the objects to another class. Using visitor patterns, we can achieve
the open-close principle.
