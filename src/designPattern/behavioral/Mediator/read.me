A Mediator Pattern says that "to define an object that encapsulates how a
set of objects interact".

I will explain the Mediator pattern by considering a problem.
When we begin with development, we have a few classes and these classes
interact with each other producing results. Now, consider slowly,
the logic becomes more complex when functionality increases.
Then what happens? We add more classes and they still interact with each other
but it gets really difficult to maintain this code now.
So, Mediator pattern takes care of this problem.

Mediator pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects
or classes. This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the
 communications between different classes and supports easy maintainability of
 the code by loose coupling.
