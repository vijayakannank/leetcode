definition - Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates
other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories.
 This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides
 one of the best ways to create an object.



 Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class
 for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying
 their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a
 factory of classes. So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one
 level higher than the Factory Pattern.
