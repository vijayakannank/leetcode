Significance of Serialization in Singleton Pattern
If singleton class is Serializable, you can serialize the singleton instance. Once it is serialized, you can deserialize it but it will not return the singleton object.

To resolve this issue, you need to override the readResolve() method that enforces the singleton. It is called just after the object is deserialized. It returns the singleton object.
