HR has a small software to keep track of the employees.
The database is in SQL Server (or other relational database) and it has a few entities.
They want to run a few custom SQL queries to find some reports.

-- group by name "Talent" -> 1 row

4. Delete duplicate rows   - https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-delete-duplicate-rows/

  a. A) Delete duplicate rows using DELETE JOIN statement
MySQL provides you with the DELETE JOIN statement that allows you to remove duplicate rows quickly.

The following statement deletes duplicate rows and keeps the highest id:

DELETE t1 FROM contacts t1
INNER JOIN contacts t2 
WHERE 
    t1.id < t2.id AND 
    t1.email = t2.email;
	
b, DELETE FROM contacts 
WHERE 
	id IN (
	SELECT 
		id 
	FROM (
		SELECT 
			id,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
				PARTITION BY email
				ORDER BY email) AS row_num
		FROM 
			contacts
		
	) t
    WHERE row_num > 1
);
