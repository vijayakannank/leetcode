1. GET
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
2. HEAD
Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.
3. POST
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.
4. PUT
Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
5. DELETE
Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.
6. PATCH
PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.
